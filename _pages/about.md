I am a PhD candidate in [Public Policy](https://www.hks.harvard.edu/educational-programs/doctoral-programs) at Harvard University. I am also an Affiliate at the [Harvard Kennedy School Program in Criminal Justice Policy and Management](https://www.hks.harvard.edu/centers/wiener/programs/criminaljustice) and Stone PhD Scholar in the [Multidisciplinary Program in Inequality and Social Policy](https://inequality.hks.harvard.edu/).

My research focuses on inequality, race, and the criminal legal system. I was the lead researcher in the report on ["Racial Disparities in the Massachusetts Criminal System"](https://wayback.archive-it.org/5456/20200909012518/http://cjpp.law.harvard.edu/assets/Massachusetts-Racial-Disparity-Report-FINAL.pdf) submitted to the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court. My current work explores the drivers of racial disparities in the criminal legal system and evaluates alternatives to law enforcement and criminal adjudication in promoting public safety.

Prior to beginning my doctoral studies, I was involved in policy research at the National Bureau of Economic Research, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, and UC Berkeleyâ€™s Institute for Research on Labor and Employment. I have a BA in economics and political science from Williams College and an MPP from the Goldman School of Public Policy at the University of California, Berkeley.
